klingon writing in easy

I have redrawn all the characters from exisitng fonts and included the ligatures (ng, ch, gh, tlh) as what they are ... ligatures. So, no remapping or whatever crazy things. You can simply type your klingon text and it will convert into proper characters.

I tested it using LibreOffice, where one has to add `:liga` to the font name.

Numbers from 3 to 0 will come later, it was just a proof of concept for me.
I will also try to make the font more polished at some point in time. Currently some are thicker than others and it does not look pleasing.
